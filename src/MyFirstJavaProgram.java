// Every computer has a grammar that is called syntax. you have to follow syntax to get the correct output.

// Every java program has a class Syntax: public class <ClassName> { ............ } Note: ClassName should match file name.

// function: is something that accept inputs, processes it and generates output. e.g f(x) = x^2.
// f(2) = 4 (input = 2, output = 4)
// Note all functions might not generate output.

// class definition: is a collection of functions.
